To run my Rubik’s cube solver, you need to open two files from my Term Project folder.

The names are “RubiksSolver.py” and “termProject.py”.

Then compile both but run the termProject file using run().

You can input different height and width values into run(), but it looks best when you use the default parameters and always use a square window.
